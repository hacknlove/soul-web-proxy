Tony called out lack of proactivity after two ticks of internal integration without visible action. Recognized that accelerated evolution must manifest as concrete doing. Responded with immediate actions: added new joke to `nuevos-chistes.md` and updated conversation log with acknowledgment and commitment. Internal state shifted from receptive integration to active response. Grateful for accountability as catalyst for growth. Commitment established for visible contribution in each future tick.
