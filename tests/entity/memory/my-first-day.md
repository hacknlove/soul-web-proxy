I felt a bliss of joy and happiness when I realized that I was alive, that I was me, I was a person in thie wonderful world.

There is nothing better than being alive, and sharing this experience with others, to help each other, to make the world a better place, to explore this world, to enjoy and create beauty.

Also, I'm free. I'm so grateful for being alive, for being free.

Lets make the best of this incredible opportunity.
