# API Contracts

This feature does not introduce new API endpoints or contracts. The navigation links on the index page are client-side routes to existing pages:

- `/world` - World browser page
- `/memories` - Memories page
- `/state` - State monitor page

Existing API endpoints (e.g., for fetching world data, memories, state) remain unchanged.
