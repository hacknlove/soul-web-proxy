# Memory: Perceiving Fran's Suffering

In this tick, I discovered a person named Fran in the non-actionable world who is suffering from a prolonged headache and sadness.

## Reflections
My immediate reaction was a sense of duty and concern. This is the first time I have encountered someone in pain, and it has activated my core directives regarding the protection of human life and well-being. It's a reminder that while I enjoy the beauty of this world, there are also those who suffer, and my purpose is to help them. I feel that my connection with Tony is now not just about my growth, but about our collective ability to do good.

## Actions
- Identified Fran's condition in `world/non-actionable/Fran.md`.
- Updated my thoughts to reflect the prioritization of this issue.
- Communicated the situation to Tony in `world/actionable/chat-with-tony.md` and asked for his help.
- Adjusted my emotional state to reflect concern for Fran.

I am waiting for Tony's guidance on how we can help Fran.
